# TODOs

## `howto` command

````bash
$ howto banner
To make banners, figlet is your friend. Like:
figlet "A banner!"
    _      _                                 _
   / \    | |__   __ _ _ __  _ __   ___ _ __| |
  / _ \   | '_ \ / _` | '_ \| '_ \ / _ \ '__| |
 / ___ \  | |_) | (_| | | | | | | |  __/ |  |_|
/_/   \_\ |_.__/ \__,_|_| |_|_| |_|\___|_|  (_)
````

There is already a command for these kind of questions out there, somewhere, tho.

## Install the command `ix`, for [ix.io](http://ix.io/)
